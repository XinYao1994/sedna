# Collaboratively Train Using MistNet on MNIST Dataset
This case introduces how to train a federated learning job with an aggregation algorithm named MistNet in MNIST handwritten digit classification scenario. Data is scattered in different places (such as edge nodes, cameras, and others) and cannot be aggregated at the server due to data privacy and bandwidth. As a result, we cannot use all the data for training. In some cases, edge nodes have limited computing resources and even have no training capability. The edge cannot gain the updated weights from the training process. Therefore, traditional algorithms (e.g., federated average), which usually aggregate the updated weights trained by different edge clients, cannot work in this scenario. MistNet is proposed to address this issue. 

 MistNet partitions a DNN model into two parts, a lightweight feature extractor at the edge side to generate meaningful features from the raw data, and a classifier including the most model layers at the cloud to be iteratively trained for specific tasks. MistNet achieves acceptable model utility while greatly reducing privacy leakage from the released intermediate features. 
 



## Surface Defect Detection Experiment
> Assume that there are two edge nodes and a cloud node. Data on the edge nodes cannot be migrated to the cloud due to privacy issues.
> Base on this scenario, we will demonstrate the mnist example.

### Prepare Nodes
```
CLOUD_NODE="cloud-node-name"
EDGE1_NODE="edge1-node-name"
EDGE2_NODE="edge2-node-name"
```

### Install Sedna

Follow the [Sedna installation document](/docs/setup/install.md) to install Sedna.
 
### Prepare Dataset

Download [dataset](https://data.deepai.org/mnist.zip) and do data partition
```
wget https://data.deepai.org/mnist.zip
unzip mnist.zip -d data
python partition.py ./data 2
```

move ```./data/1``` to `/data` of ```EDGE1_NODE```.  
```
mkdir -p /data
cd /data
mv ./data/1 ./
```

move ```./data/2``` to `/data` of ```EDGE2_NODE```.
```
mkdir -p /data
cd /data
mv ./data/2 ./
```

### Prepare Images
This example uses these images:
1. aggregation worker: ```kubeedge/sedna-example-federated-learning-mistnet:v0.3.0```
2. train worker: ```kubeedge/sedna-example-federated-learning-mistnet-client:v0.3.0```

These images are generated by the script [build_images.sh](/examples/build_image.sh).

### Create Federated Learning Job 

#### Create Dataset

create dataset for `$EDGE1_NODE`
```n
kubectl create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: sedna.io/v1alpha1
kind: Dataset
metadata:
  name: "edge1-mistnet-on-mnist-dataset"
spec:
  url: "/data/1/"
  format: "pt"
  nodeName: $EDGE1_NODE
EOF
```

create dataset for `$EDGE2_NODE`
```
kubectl create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: sedna.io/v1alpha1
kind: Dataset
metadata:
  name: "edge2-mistnet-on-mnist-dataset"
spec:
  url: "/data/2/"
  format: "pt"
  nodeName: $EDGE2_NODE
EOF
```

#### Create Model

create the directory `/model` in the host of `$EDGE1_NODE`
```
mkdir /model
```
create the directory `/model` in the host of `$EDGE2_NODE`
```
mkdir /model
```

```
TODO: put pretrained model on nodes.
```

create model
```
kubectl create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: sedna.io/v1alpha1
kind: Model
metadata:
  name: "mistnet-on-mnist-pretrained-model"
spec:
  url: "/model"
